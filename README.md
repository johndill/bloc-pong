# Bloc Pong

## Purpose

My own version of the classic game, [Pong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong).

## Use case

JavaScript is used for serious business all over the Internet, but it can also be used for pure fun! JavaScript can be used to develop all types of games, including Bloc's own [Ruby Warrior](https://www.bloc.io/ruby-warrior). It's important to solve problems as a web developer, but it's also OK to have a good time. This project is strictly about creating fun.

## Requirements

* A user can visit our application and start a new game against a computer opponent.
* A new game starts when a user visits the page, or refreshes the page.
* All games start at 0-0.
* The application will track the score of the game, until the page is closed or refreshed.
* Basic Pong rules apply to Bong, thus each time the ball gets past a paddle, a point is scored.
* The game ends when the user or computer score 21 points.

## Resources

Review this [blog post](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/pong-clone-in-javascript) on creating a Pong game. Don't just copy the code, try to make your own adjustments. Start by changing simple things like the layout orientation or color. Move on to more challenging extensions, like modifying the collision detection algorithm and making the game aesthetics more appealing.
